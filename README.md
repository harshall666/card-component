### What I learned

I learned how to add color tint to an image

```html
<div class="pic"><div class="section"></div></div>
```
```css
.pic{
  background: url(/images/image-header-mobile.jpg) no-repeat center/cover;
  height: 216px;
  width:auto;
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
}
.main .pic .section{
  background-color: hsla(277, 64%, 61%,0.75);
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
  height: 216px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will try to improve my skills to write more efficent and readable code. I will also focus more on CSS grid and flexbox layouts.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me to understand CSS grid layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
